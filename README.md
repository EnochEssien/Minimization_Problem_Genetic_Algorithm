# Minimization_Problem_Genetic_Algorithm

The aim of this project was to create a program that can provide the closest solution to the two minimization function seen below.

As such for this challenge a genetic algorithm was implemented. 
The two functions can be commented out of the code depending on which solution is being found. 
As well as two "selection methods" were used to test the effectiveness, each can be swapped out as well.
